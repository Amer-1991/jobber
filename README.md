# Bahar Project Automation Agent

Based on the [sentient](https://github.com/sentient-engineering/sentient) framework - an AI agent that automatically applies to relevant projects on the Bahar platform (https://bahr.sa) on your behalf.

## üéØ What This Agent Does

This AI-powered automation agent:
- **Logs into Bahar** automatically using your credentials
- **Discovers new projects** that match your skills and preferences  
- **Crafts personalized offers** using AI based on project requirements
- **Submits offers automatically** on your behalf
- **Monitors for new projects** continuously
- **Tracks success rates** and optimizes offers over time

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project uses the **jobber_fsm** implementation based on [finite state machines](https://github.com/sentient-engineering/multi-agent-fsm) for better scalability and reliability.

### Key Components

- **üîê Bahar Login Skill** - Handles SSO authentication with Bahar
- **üîç Project Discovery** - Finds and analyzes relevant projects
- **ü§ñ Arabic Offer Crafting** - Generates professional Arabic project proposals for Bahar platform
- **üìã Offer Submission** - Automatically submits offers to projects
- **üìä Monitoring System** - Continuously checks for new opportunities

### Legacy Note

The `jobber` folder contains a simpler implementation for job applications. The `jobber_fsm` folder contains our Bahar-specific implementation with more advanced features.

## üöÄ Setup & Installation

### 1. Install Dependencies

#### Option A: Using pip (Recommended)
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m playwright install chrome
```

#### Option B: Using Poetry
```bash
poetry install
python3 -m playwright install chrome
```

### 2. Configure Environment

1. **Copy environment template:**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```

2. **Add your configuration to `.env`:**
   ```bash
   # Arabic Offer Generation (Default)
   # The system uses professional Arabic templates
   
   # Optional: OpenAI for additional features
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   
   # Bahar credentials
   BAHAR_USERNAME=your_bahar_username
   BAHAR_PASSWORD=your_bahar_password
   ```

3. **Test Arabic Offer Generation:**
   ```bash
   python test_llama_ai.py
   ```
   This will test the Arabic offer generation system.

4. **Update user preferences:**
   ```bash
   cp jobber_fsm/user_preferences/user_preferences_template.txt jobber_fsm/user_preferences/user_preferences.txt
   ```
   Then edit `user_preferences.txt` with your information.

### 3. Test Arabic Offer Generation

```bash
python test_llama_ai.py
```

### 4. Test Bahar Login

```bash
python3 test_bahar_login.py
```

### 5. Run the Agent

```bash
python3 -u -m jobber_fsm
```

### 5. Example Task

```bash
"Find and apply to web development projects on Bahar with budget between $500-$2000"
```

### Run evals

1. For Jobber

```bash
 python -m test.tests_processor --orchestrator_type vanilla
```

2. For Jobber FSM

```bash
 python -m test.tests_processor --orchestrator_type fsm
```
