# üîí Setting Up Private Repository for Bahar Automation

## Step 1: Create Private Repository on GitHub

1. **Go to GitHub**: Open https://github.com in your browser
2. **Sign in** to your GitHub account
3. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right corner
4. **Select "New repository"**
5. **Fill in the details**:
   - **Repository name**: `bahar-automation-agent` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Description**: `AI agent for automated project discovery and offer submission on Bahar platform`
   - **Visibility**: ‚úÖ **Private** (VERY IMPORTANT!)
   - **Initialize**: Leave unchecked (we already have files)
6. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Copy the Repository URL

After creating, GitHub will show you a page with setup instructions. Copy the **HTTPS URL** that looks like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bahar-automation-agent.git
```

## Step 3: Run These Commands

Once you have the URL, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Remove the old remote origin
git remote remove origin

# Add your new private repository as origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bahar-automation-agent.git

# Add and commit the .env file and user preferences
git add .env jobber_fsm/user_preferences/user_preferences.txt
git commit -m "Add environment and user preference files for private repo access"

# Push to your private repository
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Verify Upload

Go back to your GitHub repository page and refresh. You should see all your files including:
- ‚úÖ `.env` file with your credentials
- ‚úÖ `user_preferences.txt` with your settings  
- ‚úÖ All the Bahar automation code
- ‚úÖ Documentation and analysis tools

## üîí Security Note

Since this is a **private repository**, only you can access it. This means:
- ‚úÖ Your credentials are safe
- ‚úÖ You can clone it on any device
- ‚úÖ You can sync changes across devices
- ‚ùå Nobody else can see your sensitive information

## üì± Access from Other Devices

On any other device:
1. **Install Git**: If not already installed
2. **Clone your repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bahar-automation-agent.git
   cd bahar-automation-agent
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   python3 -m playwright install chrome
   ```
4. **Run the agent**:
   ```bash
   python3 test_bahar_login.py  # Test login
   python3 -u -m jobber_fsm     # Run full agent
   ```

Your `.env` file and preferences will already be there! üéâ
